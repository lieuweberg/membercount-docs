# Supporting The Bot

## Donations

Donating is the most consistent way for you to support the bot. You will also get additional benefits such as premium features and a Patron role on our [support server](https://discord.gg/dWMgWWw). As Discord bots are not hosted for free, donations are important to keep the bot running.

Visit the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/member_count) page and become a patron today!

## Upvote

You can visit [discordbots.org](https://discordbots.org/bot/membercount) and click on the _Upvote_ button for Member Count. Doing something as simple as that every day will certainly help to grow the bot!

## Voluntary Support

If you're knowledgeable about the bot and wish to help others, join the [support server](https://discord.gg/dWMgWWw) and start helping out.

Read the rules, and, most importantly, please provide correct information!
